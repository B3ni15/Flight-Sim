# 3D Models Folder (Optional)

This folder is **optional** - the game now uses procedural 3D models by default.

## Adding Custom Models

If you want to use custom models, place `.glb` or `.gltf` files here:

### Optional Files
- `a320.glb` - Custom Airbus A320 aircraft
- `runway.glb` - Custom airport/runway

## Notes

- Models are optional - the game works without them
- If a file exists, it will be loaded instead of the procedural model
- Recommended model size: < 10MB for web performance
- Supported formats: .glb, .gltf

## Procedural Models Included

The game includes detailed procedural models:
- **A320**: Fuselage, wings, engines, landing gear, cockpit windows, winglets
- **Airport**: 4km runway, taxiways, apron, terminal buildings, control tower, lights, signs
